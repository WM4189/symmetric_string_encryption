This refactor creates a basic tkinter GUI that allows you to generate a key, input a string, encrypt the string, and decrypt the encrypted text. The UI elements are organized in a more user-friendly manner, and the functionality of the original code is integrated into the UI using methods within the StringEncryptorApp class.
