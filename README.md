This refactor creates a basic tkinter GUI that allows you to generate a key, input a string, encrypt the string, and decrypt the encrypted text. The UI elements are organized in a more user-friendly manner, and the functionality of the original code is integrated into the UI using methods within the StringEncryptorApp class.

(The encrypted text being different every time, even with the same key, is due to the nature of the encryption process and the use of an Initialization Vector (IV). In symmetric encryption schemes like Fernet, an IV is used along with the key to ensure that the same plaintext encrypted with the same key produces different ciphertext each time.  The use of an IV is a security measure that prevents attackers from gaining insights into the content of the encrypted data by analyzing patterns in the ciphertext. The IV is randomly generated and is combined with the encryption key to create a unique context for each encryption operation.  When you decrypt the data, the IV is also used in the decryption process to correctly retrieve the original plaintext. This is handled transparently by the Fernet library, so you don't need to worry about it explicitly. 
 In summary, the different encrypted text you're seeing is a result of the encryption algorithm's use of an IV combined with the encryption key to produce unique ciphertexts even when encrypting the same plaintext.)
